# Phase 11.3 - Execution Policy Compatibility Declaration

## Intent

Defines compatibility rules between different policy versions and declares valid policy combinations.

## Authoritative Document

`Execution Policy Compatibility Declaration.md` - Contains the complete specification for policy version compatibility and combination rules.

## Data-Only Nature

This phase contains pure compatibility definitions with zero behavior. Policy compatibility structures are immutable declarations that specify valid combinations without implementing compatibility logic.

## Non-Goals

- No policy migration or transformation logic
- No runtime compatibility checking
- No automatic policy version resolution
- No policy conflict resolution algorithms
- No dynamic compatibility determination
- No policy upgrade or downgrade behavior
- No compatibility enforcement mechanisms
- No policy negotiation or adaptation

## Scope

Defines policy version compatibility matrices, valid policy combinations, and compatibility constraint declarations. All compatibility rules are declarative constraints only.
