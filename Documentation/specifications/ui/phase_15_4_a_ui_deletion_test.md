# Phase 15.4-A — UI Deletion Test (Replaceability Proof)

Status: FROZEN (Phase 15 Architectural Contract)
Scope: UI Replaceability Verification
Authority: CLI Canonical Contract

# UI Deletion Test (Replaceability Proof)

## 1. Test Scenario Definition

UI deletion means complete removal of all Qt-based components including:
- All Qt widget implementations and their associated files
- Qt adapter implementations that bridge CLI to UI
- Qt-specific configuration files and UI state persistence
- Qt application framework and windowing system integration
- All UI-related build targets, dependencies, and deployment artifacts

The test boundary excludes CLI executables and all CLI-accessible functionality.

## 2. What Must Remain Functional

### CLI Command Execution
Any CLI-exposed command execution MUST remain unchanged including:
- CLI parameter acceptance and validation behavior
- CLI output format and content generation
- CLI exit codes and error reporting mechanisms
- CLI help text and usage information display
- CLI configuration file processing and validation

### CLI-Accessible Operations
Any CLI-exposed operations MUST continue identically including:
- CLI job creation and execution commands
- CLI batch processing and file operations
- CLI configuration management commands
- CLI status reporting and query operations
- CLI diagnostic and troubleshooting commands

### CLI Output Generation
Any CLI-exposed output generation MUST remain unaffected including:
- CLI result formatting and data presentation
- CLI progress reporting and status updates
- CLI error message generation and formatting
- CLI log output and diagnostic information
- CLI completion notifications and summaries

## 3. What Artifacts Must Remain Valid

### CLI-Accessible Configuration
Any CLI-accessible configuration files MUST remain authoritative including:
- Configuration files readable by CLI commands
- Parameter files processable by CLI operations
- Template files usable by CLI workflows
- Schema files validatable by CLI parsers
- Policy files interpretable by CLI engines

### CLI-Generated Outputs
Any CLI-generated output files MUST maintain validity including:
- Result files produced by CLI operations
- Log files written by CLI processes
- Report files generated by CLI commands
- Data files created by CLI workflows
- Status files maintained by CLI operations

### CLI-Readable Inputs
Any CLI-readable input formats MUST remain accessible including:
- Job definition files parseable by CLI
- Batch specification files processable by CLI
- Configuration files readable by CLI parsers
- Data files consumable by CLI operations
- Template files expandable by CLI processors

## 4. What Workflows Must Be Unaffected

### CLI Command Sequences
Any CLI-exposed command sequences MUST remain available including:
- Multi-step CLI workflows and command chaining
- CLI batch processing and automation sequences
- CLI configuration and setup procedures
- CLI monitoring and status checking sequences
- CLI diagnostic and troubleshooting procedures

### CLI Parameter Patterns
Any CLI-exposed parameter patterns MUST continue unchanged including:
- CLI argument parsing and validation behavior
- CLI option combinations and constraint checking
- CLI input file processing and format validation
- CLI output specification and formatting options
- CLI error handling and recovery parameter processing

## 5. What Is Explicitly Lost (And Why That Is Acceptable)

### Visual Presentation Only
UI deletion removes exclusively presentation capabilities including:
- Graphical display of CLI-available information
- Interactive forms for CLI parameter collection
- Visual formatting of CLI output data
- Graphical representation of CLI status information
- Visual navigation of CLI-accessible functionality

### Input Convenience Only
UI deletion removes only input convenience mechanisms including:
- Point-and-click alternatives to CLI parameter specification
- Visual file selection alternatives to CLI path specification
- Graphical configuration alternatives to CLI configuration commands
- Interactive workflow alternatives to CLI command sequences
- Visual help alternatives to CLI documentation commands

### Display State Only
UI deletion removes only ephemeral display state including:
- Window positions and visual layout preferences
- Visual selection states and navigation history
- Display formatting preferences for CLI output
- Temporary visual caching of CLI results
- User interface customization for CLI data presentation

These losses are acceptable because they represent only presentation alternatives to CLI-accessible functionality.

## 6. Architectural Violations (Failure Conditions)

### CLI Command Availability Loss
If any CLI command becomes unavailable or changes behavior after UI deletion, this indicates the UI owned functionality in violation of Phase 15 architecture.

### CLI Output Format Changes
If any CLI output format or content changes after UI deletion, this proves the UI contained authoritative data generation in violation of adapter-only constraints.

### CLI Parameter Processing Changes
If any CLI parameter validation or processing behavior changes after UI deletion, this demonstrates UI ownership of command logic in violation of CLI authority.

### CLI File Format Invalidation
If any CLI-readable file format becomes invalid or requires modification after UI deletion, this proves UI ownership of data authority in violation of terminal consumer constraints.

### CLI Workflow Behavior Changes
If any CLI command sequence produces different outcomes after UI deletion, this indicates UI semantic control in violation of display-only constraints.

## 7. Replaceability Guarantee

### CLI Behavior Preservation
This test guarantees that all CLI-exposed behavior remains identical regardless of UI presence, proving the UI layer contains no CLI-affecting functionality.

### CLI Authority Maintenance
This test proves that CLI commands retain complete authority over all system operations, demonstrating no CLI functionality depends on UI component existence.

### CLI Interface Completeness
This test validates that CLI provides complete access to all system capabilities, ensuring no functionality exists exclusively through UI components and maintaining CLI as the sole behavioral interface.

### UI Technology Independence
This test ensures any UI technology can be substituted without affecting CLI behavior, maintaining architectural constraints that preserve CLI supremacy and prevent UI semantic ownership.
