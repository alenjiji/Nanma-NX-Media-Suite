# 🔒 Nanma NX-MediaSuite — **Phase 10 Official Freeze**

## Deterministic Retry Engine

**Phase 10 — Deterministic Retries, Replay Persistence & Verification**

---

## Scope (Final & Locked)

Phase 10 introduces **deterministic execution replayability** without adding recovery, scheduling, or autonomy.

### Included Sub-Phases

| Sub-Phase | Name                                               | Status     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 10.1      | Deterministic Retry Engine                         | ✅ Complete |
| 10.2      | Execution Persistence for Replay                   | ✅ Complete |
| 10.3      | Deterministic Replay Driver & Verification Harness | ✅ Complete |

## Guarantees (Now Immutable)

Phase 10 guarantees:

* Explicit, deterministic retry execution
* Immutable execution intent (`JobExecutionSpec`)
* Unique `SessionJobId` per attempt
* Append-only, replay-only execution persistence
* Offline deterministic replay
* Explicit divergence detection
* Zero time, zero randomness, zero autonomy

---

## Explicit Non-Guarantees (Sealed)

Phase 10 **does not** provide:

* Resume or recovery
* Scheduling or retry policies
* Checkpointing
* Progress tracking
* Runtime intelligence
* Environment or machine state persistence
* Execution optimization

Any such behavior belongs to **Phase 11+** only.

---

## Architectural Invariants (Frozen)

These invariants are now **non-negotiable**:

* Persistence explains the past; never controls the future
* Replay is forensic, not operational
* Retry is explicit, never autonomous
* Determinism is structural, not temporal
* Execution state is never resumed

---

## Validation Status

Phase 10 has been:

* Implemented
* Unit-tested
* Negative-capability tested
* Replay-verified
* Re-validated after corrections
* Audited for roadmap compliance

No open TODOs remain.

---

## Roadmap Update Statement

> **Phase 10 is complete and frozen.**
> All future work must treat Phase 10 behavior as immutable.
> Any recovery, scheduling, or policy logic must begin in Phase 11.
